## Main features

- Real time chat

- Cloud based authentication

- Multiple distinct chat rooms (channels and servers)

- User Interface replication

- Smooth modal animations

## Objectives & Outcomes

The main motivation for this work was to tie up a variety of concepts so far acquired and replicate one of my favorite websites as closely as possible, integreting some of its core features and the general look and feel of the UI.

In summary, the objectives were:

- Replicate [Discord](https://discord.com/)'s interface and some of its most recognizable features;
- Learn and utilize the Styled Components library as a mean to create reusable components throughout the application;
- Learn and utilize the Framer Motion library for smooth animations;
- Deploy an application using Firebase as a Backend;
- Work with Firebase's external API in order to retrieve and correctly display data;
- Further improve React proficiency in functional components using Hooks;
